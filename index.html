    <h2>Orton-Gillingham</h2>
    <p>
      The Orton-Gillingham approach is specifically designed for working with
      students with dyslexia, but it can also help all students with reading
      difficulties. It uses a multisensory approach to teach phonics specifics,
      syllable types, and spelling patterns. All skills are taught auditorily,
      visually, and physically. It is a cumulative approach that reinforces
      learned skills each lesson. (include binder doc on this page)
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical lesson consists of an audio review of sounds, visual review of
      sounds, blending practice, reading practice, syllabication, new concept
      instruction, reinforcement of new concept thought auditory, visual, and
      physical practice, and spelling with the new and old concepts. Each
      session ends with reading practice.
